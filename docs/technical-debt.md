# Technical debt journal

1. There's a problem that it's not easy to add arbitrary JS code
2. Arbitrary Vue component used here and there would also be welcome
3. I forgot how to make static files because README was not updated
4. There's no deployment script. I'm not saying automated pipeline (as it's a bit costly)
5. There's a lot of time since I set up this repository. There's probably no fixtures for starting the repository fresh
